# Stage-Aware Learning

This repository contains the code for the paper "Stage-Aware Learning for Dynamic Treatments."

In this code repo, we will show the entire pipeline of fitting SAL/SWL, including calculating propensity scores and finding stage weights. Model are defined in the *model.py* and the training pipeline is illustrated in the *demo.ipynb*.

Simulation folder contains the reproducible code for the simulation section in the paper. We additionally provide the code for all competing methods, such as Q-learning, C-learning, and outcome weighted learning Check the *simulation/run_simulation.py* for more details.
